Git-Ally - Automation around Github.com Repository Management

## Install

    $ npm i -g gally

## Github Credentials

You will be prompted to enter a personal github token that will then be stored as plain text on disk.

If an environment variable `GH_TOKEN` is present and credentials are not set, 
the environment variable is used and no prompt is displayed. Will never prompt if running in CI.

## Contents of `.gally.json`

To create a config template run `ga init`. The configuration is an object with the following top level keys.

### defaultBranch

Type: `string`<br>
The default branch for the github repository.

### contribBranch

Type: `string`<br>
The branch used as target for pull requests. Defaults to `dev`.

### repository.url

Type: `string`<br>
The main github repository of this project.

### protection

Type: `object`<br>
Define protection definition as entries in the object. Key names can be freely chosen, values have to be defined according to the [github api docs](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/branches/#update-branch-protection). Can use `"@"` key to extend from other protections.

### branches

Type: `object`<br>
Define branch names as keys in this object, mapping to their configuration. 

Configurations are objects with the following keys: `protection (string)` needs to reference a protection in the protection object, or null if not protection is desired, `create (boolean)` will determine if the branch should be created if not found in the repository. New branches are created using the default branch as a base.

You can define prefix matching by appending a star to the name. Prefix matching currently only supports an empty configuration.

## Cli Commands

All commands are available as `ga` or `gally`.

### pr [branch]

Open PR Url from `origin/CURRNET_BRANCH` to remote `upstream/TARGET_BRANCH` with

    $ ga pr [branch]

where `branch` is the target branch (defaults to dev).

### promote [remote] \<branch\>

Create PR from `upstream/INPUT_BRANCH` to "upstream" branch `upstream/BRANCH` with

    $ ga promote <branch>

where the upstream branch is defined in the configuration file under "upstream".

You can define a custom remote if so desired.

When an unknown branch or a branch without an upstream is defined, a warning is printed. This makes is easier to use to create automatic staging prs using CI.

### init

Create a new `.gally.json` file by running

    $ ga init

For details on how to adjust the configuration, see the corresponding section.

### sync [remote]

Synchronize config `.gally.json` to remote github repository defined in config or using remote if passed.
